rincon-go is a client library for accessing the [Rincon API](https://github.com/bk1031/rincon).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

rincon-go requires [Go](https://go.dev/) version [1.21](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.21.0) or above.

### Installing

With [Go's module support](https://go.dev/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules), `go [build|run|test]` automatically fetches the necessary dependencies when you add the import in your code:

```sh
import "github.com/bk1031/rincon-go"
```

Alternatively, use `go get`:

```sh
go get -u github.com/bk1031/rincon-go
```
